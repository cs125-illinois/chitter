## Install

To install all dependencies, first install Node 12 (the exact version is in `.tool-versions`).
Next:

```sh
npm i
cd example && npm i
```

Once everything is installed, `npm start` will run the client bundler and example website.
You need to run `npm start backend` separately to bring up the development MongoDB instance.
